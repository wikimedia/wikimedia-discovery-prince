Breakdown of Wikipedia Portal Visitors' First Visit by Geography
=======

This dashboard shows the geographical breakdown at first visit action and ignores any subsequent visits the user may have made. The actions are:

1. **No action**: Not taking any action on the page.
2. **Other projects**: clicking the links to Wiktionary, Wikisource, etc. on the bottom of the page.
3. **Primary links**: the prominent links to languages around the globe.
4. **Search**: using the Search box and button.
5. **Other languages**: using the "Other languages" links near the bottom of the page which take you to a list of Wikipedias.
6. **Secondary links**: the less-prominent plaintext links to languages.

The values are expressed as numbers (sampled at a 1:200 rate) and as percentages - so if a country has the value "61.3" for search action, then in first visits, 61.3% of all searches are done by users from this country.

Notes
------

* This dashboard is aim to expand the "other" countries display in the current [Portal Dashboard](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/portal/#country_breakdown) to reflect more data that we're interested in seeing. See [T138107](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T138107) for more details.
* Broadly-speaking, it's worth noting that (as with all data based on JavaScript logging) the code that gathers this information requires a certain amount of browser capabilities to function. It's probably not going to work on 10 year old Nokia brick phones, and so the data will be biased against users using those kinds of devices.
* On 28 June 2016 our Event Logging system started recording a finer view of U.S. traffic, breaking it down into 5 regions:
    - **Northeast Region**
        - New England Division: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont
        - Middle Atlantic Division: New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania
    - **Midwest Region**
        - East North Central Division: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin
        - West North Central Division: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota
    - **South Region**
        - South Atlantic Division: Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia
        - East South Central Division: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee
        - West South Central Division: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas
    - **West Region**
        - Mountain Division: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming
    - **Pacific Region**
        - Alaska, California, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington

Outages and inaccuracies
------

- 13 September 2016: Added event logging of language-switching, causing some events to flow into old table and some events to flow into the new table. See [T143149](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T143149) for more details.
