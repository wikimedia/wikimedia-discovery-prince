Where users come from to the Wikipedia portal
=======

This measures where portal users come from each day, displaying the proportion of users from each top-10 country and the proportion from other countries, as a percentage.

Notes
------

* Broadly-speaking, it's worth noting that (as with all data based on JavaScript logging) the code that gathers this information requires a certain amount of browser capabilities to function. It's probably not going to work on 10 year old Nokia brick phones, and so the data will be biased against users using those kinds of devices.
* __A__: On 28 June 2016 our Event Logging system started recording a finer view of U.S. traffic, breaking it down into 5 regions:
    - **Northeast Region**
        - New England Division: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont
        - Middle Atlantic Division: New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania
    - **Midwest Region**
        - East North Central Division: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin
        - West North Central Division: Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota and South Dakota
    - **South Region**
        - South Atlantic Division: Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia
        - East South Central Division: Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee
        - West South Central Division: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas
    - **West Region**
        - Mountain Division: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming
    - **Pacific Region**
