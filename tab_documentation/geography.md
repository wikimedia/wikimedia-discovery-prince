Outages and inaccuracies

Broadly-speaking, it's worth noting that (as with all data based on JavaScript logging) the code that gathers this information requires a certain amount of browser capabilities to function. It's probably not going to work on 10 year old Nokia brick phones, and so the data will be biased against users using those kinds of devices.
