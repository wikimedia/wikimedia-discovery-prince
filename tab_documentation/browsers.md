What users use to view the Wikipedia portal
=======

This measures which Internet browsers portal users use from each day, displaying the proportion of traffic accounted for by the browser. For any given day, we only record browsers with at least 0.5% share of users.

Sorting options
------
* __Alphabetical sorting__ and __sorting by last recorded percentage__ do what they say on the tin.
* __Sorting by popularity growth/decay__ uses an estimated rate (computed by fitting an exponential model).
* __Sorting by number of times__ can be useful because a browser is only included if it has at least 0.5% share, so the number of times can be regarded as a rough estimate of longevity.

Outages and inaccuracies
------
None so far!
