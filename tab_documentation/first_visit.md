Breakdown of Wikipedia Portal visitors' first visit
=======

In [the clickthroughs tab](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/portal/#clickthrough_rate) we look at the actual rate of clickthroughs. In the [actions breakdown tab](http://discovery.wmflabs.org/portal/#breakdown) we look at the proportions of sessions performing various types of actions. *This* graph shows the actions breakdown at first visit and ignores any subsequent visits the user may have made. The options are:

1. **Language search**: the "find a language" box.
2. **No action**: Not taking any action on the page.
3. **Other projects**: clicking the links to Wiktionary, Wikisource, etc. on the bottom of the page.
4. **Primary links**: the prominent links to languages around the globe.
5. **Search**: using the Search box and button.
6. **Other languages**: using the "Other languages" links near the bottom of the page which take you to a list of Wikipedias.
7. **Secondary links**: the less-prominent plaintext links to languages.

The values are expressed as percentages - so if a feature has the value "61.3" it is being used 61.3% of the time.

In the future, we might include data such as the average time to first clickthrough from initial page landing.
