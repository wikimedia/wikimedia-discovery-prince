Wikimedia portal clickthrough rate
=======

A lot of people visit the [Wikipedia portal](https://www.wikipedia.org) - but what proportion actually go anywhere within our sites from it?

This dashboard tracks the proportion of visits to the portal that end in a click through to one of our projects - via search or via one of the links. This is expressed as a percentage - so a value of "39.4" means that 39.4% of visits end in a clickthrough.

General trends

Outages and inaccuracies
------

* From 7 December (marked "A") the sampling changed to exclude a broader range of browsers, resulting in alterations to things
like clickthrough rate and dwell time. We expect this to resolve itself on 4 January when a new schema version is launched.

Broadly-speaking, it's worth noting that (as with all data based on JavaScript logging) the code that gathers this information requires a certain amount of browser capabilities to function. It's probably not going to work on 10 year old Nokia brick phones, and so the data will be biased against users using those kinds of devices.
