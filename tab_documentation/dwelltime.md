Dwell-time on the Wikipedia portal
=======

This measures "dwell-time" on the Wikipedia portal: the amount of time people spend between arriving at the page and leaving. As "leaving" is defined as clicking on something for data collection purposes, this only covers the population that actually clicks through to pages or using search, not the population that simply closes their tab or browser, or goes to a different website altogether.

General trends

Outages and inaccuracies
------

* From 7 December (marked "A") the sampling changed to exclude a broader range of browsers, resulting in alterations to things
like clickthrough rate and dwell time. We expect this to resolve itself on 4 January when a new schema version is launched.

Broadly-speaking, it's worth noting that (as with all data based on JavaScript logging) the code that gathers this information requires a certain amount of browser capabilities to function. It's probably not going to work on 10 year old Nokia brick phones, and so the data will be biased against users using those kinds of devices.
